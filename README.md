# Config files

## Nix
I've started the process of leveraging [Nix](https://nixos.org/explore.html) to manage my system configurations. This repo holds files used for managing user environments with [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), largely adapted from the wonderful examples at [nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) and the same author's more advanced [nix-config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config), with later work borroweed from [GaetanLepage/nix-config](https://github.com/GaetanLepage/nix-config).
